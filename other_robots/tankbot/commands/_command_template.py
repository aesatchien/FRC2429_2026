"""
This module serves as a template for creating new commands for the robot.

To create a new command:
1. Copy this file and rename it to something descriptive (e.g., `shooter_continuous_fire.py`).
2. Change the class name from `CommandTemplate` to a name that reflects the command's purpose (e.g., `FireShooter`).
3. In the `__init__` method:
    - Set a descriptive name for the command using `self.setName()` - this will show up in the start/end messages.
    - Add any required subsystems using `self.addRequirements()`.
4. Implement the command's logic in the following methods:
    - `initialize()`: Called once when the command is scheduled. Use it for one-time setup.
    - `execute()`: Called repeatedly while the command is running. This is where the main logic goes.
    - `isFinished()`: Called repeatedly to check if the command has completed. Return `True` when it's done.
    - `end(interrupted)`: Called once when the command finishes (or is interrupted). Use it for cleanup.

This template provides a basic structure with logging to the console and SmartDashboard
to aid in debugging.
